While plants do absorb CO₂ through photosynthesis, the rate of CO₂ emissions from human activities far exceeds the capacity of plants to absorb it. Climate models have been generally accurate in predicting the trends of global warming, with observed temperatures aligning closely with model projections. The assertion that climate change is a lie is not supported by the overwhelming scientific consensus and evidence showing that global warming is occurring and largely driven by human activities.",
