**Summary of the Prosecutor’s Arguments:**
The prosecutor raises concerns about the defense's selective interpretation of evidence supporting the client's claims regarding the increase in the global polar bear population, the coral cover of the Great Barrier Reef, and the decline in extreme-heat deaths. The prosecutor argues that the defense overlooks broader contexts, long-term consequences, and methodological limitations, undermining the robustness of the client's claims.

**Weaknesses in the Prosecutor’s Arguments:**
1. The prosecutor overly generalizes by emphasizing the negative impacts of climate change without acknowledging any positive developments or improvements in specific areas.
2. The prosecutor fails to provide concrete evidence to counter the specific claims made by the defense, relying instead on speculative assertions and potential risks without solid data to contradict the client's position.
3. The prosecutor's arguments lack a balanced assessment that recognizes any positive trends or advancements related to the client's claims, presenting a one-sided view based solely on negative consequences.

**Defense’s Rebuttal:**
1. Regarding the Polar Bear Population Increase, the prosecutor emphasizes the long-term impacts of climate change on polar bears but fails to acknowledge that specific populations have indeed shown growth (\textit{Global\_Warming\_of\_1.5.pdf}, p.273). The defense highlights these localized increases, which are crucial in contradicting the overall decline narrative presented by the prosecutor.
   
2. Concerning the Great Barrier Reef Coral Cover, while the prosecutor mentions the risks to coral reefs, the defense's point about increased coral cover at present remains valid. The prosecutor's argument does not refute the fact that, currently, the Great Barrier Reef has more coral cover than at any point since 1986 (\textit{Global\_Warming\_of\_1.5.pdf}, p.266), supporting the defense's position.

3. In terms of the Decline in Extreme-Heat Deaths, the prosecutor's argument relies on potential risks and complexities without presenting direct evidence to counter the claim of a decline. The defense's assertion aligns with the lack of specific data refuting the decline in extreme-heat deaths (\textit{SYR\_AR5\_FINAL\_full\_wcover.pdf}, p.70), strengthening the client's position.

**Strengthening the Client’s Position:**
- The global polar bear population increase is supported by localized growth data, countering the overall decline narrative.
- The current higher coral cover at the Great Barrier Reef indicates positive developments despite acknowledged risks.
- The absence of concrete evidence refuting the decline in extreme-heat deaths supports the client's claim.

**Conclusion:**
The prosecution's arguments lack sufficient evidence to undermine the client's claims. By highlighting specific positive trends within the broader challenges posed by climate change, the defense's position remains strong. The prosecutor's failure to provide direct refutations and reliance on general negative implications weaken their counterarguments. Therefore, the client's claims regarding the polar bear population, the Great Barrier Reef, and extreme-heat deaths should be upheld based on the evidence presented.
