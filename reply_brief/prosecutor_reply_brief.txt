Prosecutor's Reply Brief:

The defense attempts to support the client's claim that global warming is not progressing as predicted by climate models and that plants are absorbing more CO2 through selected studies, such as hleussner et al. (2016), Taub et al. (2008), Högy et al. (2009), and De Souza et al. (2015). While these studies may provide some insights into specific aspects of climate change and plant behavior, they do not negate the overwhelming body of scientific evidence that supports the reality of climate change and its impacts.

It is important to note that cherry-picking studies that seem to align with the client's claim does not invalidate the vast consensus in the scientific community regarding the existence and seriousness of climate change. The client's assertion that "기후 변화는 거짓말이다" disregards the extensive research and data confirming the reality of climate change, including rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and increasing frequency of extreme weather events.

While it is acknowledged that there may be uncertainties and variations in climate modeling, the overall trend and impacts of global warming are well-established and supported by decades of research from reputable scientific institutions worldwide. The client's claim undermines the urgent need for action to mitigate the effects of climate change and transition to a more sustainable future.

In conclusion, the defense's attempt to downplay the significance of climate change based on selective evidence is not valid in light of the overwhelming consensus among the scientific community. The client's denial of climate change is unsubstantiated and contradicted by the preponderance of scientific evidence supporting the reality of this critical global issue.
