**Summary of the claim**: The client claims that global warming is not progressing as predicted by climate models because plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO₂ than expected, leading them to conclude that climate change is a fabrication.

**Weaknesses in the evidence**:
1. The client's argument fails to consider the consensus among climate scientists regarding the role of plant photosynthesis in global warming. The evidence provided by Working Group II of AR5 and IPCC WG3 AR5 confirms that rising CO2 concentrations stimulate photosynthesis, contributing to increased terrestrial ecosystem productivity (Global_Warming_of_1.5.pdf, p.234; ipcc_wg3_ar5_full.pdf, p.511). This directly contradicts the client's assertion that plant photosynthesis is not a significant factor in global warming.

**Counterarguments**:
1. The consensus among climate scientists, as evidenced by the reports, highlights the crucial role of plant photosynthesis in global warming. The stimulation of photosynthesis by rising CO2 levels directly impacts terrestrial ecosystem productivity, indicating that plant photosynthesis does contribute to the progression of global warming (Global_Warming_of_1.5.pdf, p.234; ipcc_wg3_ar5_full.pdf, p.511).

**Conclusion**:
The evidence provided in the document strongly contradicts the client's claim that plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO₂ than expected, leading to the assertion that climate change is a hoax. The consensus among climate scientists and the scientific evidence presented in the reports clearly indicate the significant role of plant photosynthesis in global warming. Therefore, the client's claim is unsubstantiated and should be dismissed.
