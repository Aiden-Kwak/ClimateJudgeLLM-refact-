**Summary of the claim:** The client argues that global warming is not progressing as predicted by climate models because plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO₂ than expected, leading to the claim that climate change is a lie.

**Weaknesses in the evidence:**
1. The client's argument heavily relies on the assumption that plant photosynthesis is the main factor impacting the progression of global warming, ignoring other significant factors (Global_Warming_of_1.5.pdf, p.81).
2. The evidence provided does not directly support the claim that plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO₂ than predicted by climate models. Instead, it mentions theoretical impacts of geoengineering on photosynthesis without concrete observations (Global_Warming_of_1.5.pdf, p.234).
3. The document acknowledges that natural internal variability and external forcings can counteract each other, weakening the client's simplistic view that plant photosynthesis alone can explain discrepancies in climate models (SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf, p.60).

**Counterarguments:**
1. While plant photosynthesis can impact climate models, studies suggest that other factors such as stratospheric sulfate geoengineering, societal debates, land-use changes, and biofuel production also influence global warming progression (Global_Warming_of_1.5.pdf, p.81).
2. The client's claim overlooks the complexity of climate systems and the various feedback loops that can affect global warming beyond plant photosynthesis (SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf, p.60).
3. Studies indicate that changes in carbon storage and vegetation response vary based on forcing change rates and specific regions, implying a more nuanced relationship between plant photosynthesis and climate model projections (Global_Warming_of_1.5.pdf, p.234).

**Conclusion:** The client's claim that plant photosynthesis alone explains the discrepancies in climate models is oversimplified and contradicted by the evidence provided. Climate scientists recognize the multifaceted nature of global warming, considering factors beyond photosynthesis. Therefore, the client's assertion that climate change is a lie due to plant photosynthesis absorbing more CO₂ than expected is invalid and lacks substantial support from the presented evidence.
