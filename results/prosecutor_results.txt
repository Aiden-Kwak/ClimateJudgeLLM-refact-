Based on the provided evidence, it is clear that the original claim stating "지구 온난화는 기후 모델이 예측한 만큼 진행되지 않고 있다. 이는 식물의 광합성이 예상보다 더 많은 CO2를 흡수하고 있기 때문이다. 기후 변화는 거짓말이다" is not supported. The research and data presented in the document emphasize the ongoing impact of climate change, with studies showing significant changes related to global warming. The evidence also supports the fact that plants absorbing more CO2 can have implications for food composition and nutritional security, which aligns with the broader context of climate change effects.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the evidence provided, it can be concluded that climate change is real and ongoing, contrary to the original claim that it is a lie. The scientific research and data clearly demonstrate the serious impact of climate change and the need for urgent action to address its consequences.
