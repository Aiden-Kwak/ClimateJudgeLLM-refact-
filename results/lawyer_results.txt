**Summary of the claim:** The client claims that global warming is not progressing as predicted by climate models because plants are absorbing more CO2 than expected, thus asserting that climate change is a hoax.

**Supporting evidence:**
The document mentions the limitations of climate models in reproducing the observed warming trends without considering anthropogenic influences (ar4_syr.pdf, p.17). It also highlights the dependencies and biases among climate models that can affect global surface warming predictions (ipcc_wg3_ar5_full.pdf, p.193). Furthermore, it points out the uncertainties in the models due to their common ancestry and shared parameterizations (Global_Warming_of_1.5.pdf, p.193).

**Counterarguments:**
The evidence from the document does not directly support the claim that climate change is a hoax due to increased CO2 absorption by plants. The client's assertion lacks direct scientific backing or specific data to prove that the increased CO2 absorption alone explains the discrepancy in climate model predictions.

**Conclusion:**
While the evidence from the document highlights the complexities and uncertainties in climate modeling, it does not definitively support the client's extreme claim that climate change is a hoax mainly because of increased CO2 absorption by plants. The scientific consensus overwhelmingly supports the reality of anthropogenic climate change, and the client's argument lacks substantial empirical evidence to refute this consensus. Therefore, the claim that climate change is a hoax based on plant CO2 absorption exceeding predictions is not adequately supported by the provided evidence.
