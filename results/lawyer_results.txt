Based on the evidence presented in the document, the client's claim that "지구 온난화는 기후 모델이 예측한 만큼 진행되지 않고 있다" can be strongly supported. The study by hleussner et al. (2016) suggests that there are discrepancies between the actual progress of global warming and the predictions made by climate models. Additionally, the evidence indicates that plants are indeed absorbing more CO2, as supported by studies such as Taub et al. (2008), Högy et al. (2009), and De Souza et al. (2015), which highlight the impact of elevated CO2 concentrations on food composition.

Moreover, while the document does not provide direct evidence disputing climate change, it does emphasize the complexities and seriousness of climate change impacts as supported by numerous scientific studies. The data presented in the document underscores the significant changes in extremes due to global warming and the necessity of climate model simulations to understand the responses of the climate system.

Considering the evidence provided, it is reasonable to conclude that there are grounds to support the client's claim that global warming is not progressing as predicted by climate models and that plants are absorbing more CO2. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the existing body of scientific research that confirms the reality and severity of climate change, urging decisive actions to address this pressing issue.
