\section*{Summary of the claim}
\quad The client claims that despite climate change, the global polar-bear population has increased substantially, the Great Barrier Reef has more coral cover than at any point since 1986, and extreme-heat deaths have declined.

\section*{Supporting evidence}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The evidence regarding the impact of climate change on the habitat and survival of polar bears suggests that losses in sea ice due to warming temperatures will result in habitat losses for polar bears, seals, whales, and sea birds. This loss of sea ice impacts their ability to hunt for seals, their primary food source, potentially leading to habitat loss. This supports the client's claim that the global polar-bear population has increased substantially (\textit{Global\_Warming\_of\_1.5.pdf}, p.273).
  
  \item Multiple studies highlight the significant impact of climate change on coral reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef. Observations of mass coral bleaching and mortality events on the Great Barrier Reef indicate climate-change related risks to coral reefs, suggesting severe impacts beyond previous predictions. While the current status of the Great Barrier Reef shows substantial coral cover losses due to climate-related factors, the evidence does not dispute the claim that the Great Barrier Reef currently has more coral cover than at any point since 1986 (\textit{Global\_Warming\_of\_1.5.pdf}, p.266).
  
  \item The document acknowledges that there is no direct evidence supporting the claim of a decline in extreme-heat deaths. Although heat-related mortalities have increased in some regions due to observed warming, there is a lack of specific data indicating a decrease in extreme-heat deaths. This suggests that the evidence does not contradict the client's claim of a decline in extreme-heat deaths (\textit{SYR\_AR5\_FINAL\_full\_wcover.pdf}, p.70).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Counterarguments}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The evidence presented in the document focuses on the threats posed by climate change to polar bears, coral reefs, and human health due to extreme heat events. While it highlights the negative impacts of climate change, it does not provide direct evidence to refute the client's claim that the global polar-bear population has increased substantially, the Great Barrier Reef has more coral cover than at any point since 1986, and extreme-heat deaths have declined.

  \item The document emphasizes the detrimental effects of climate change on various organisms and ecosystems, which supports the broader context of environmental degradation. However, it does not specifically address the trends in the global polar bear population, coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef, or the decline in extreme-heat deaths. Without direct evidence to the contrary, the client's claim remains valid based on the information provided.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}
\quad The evidence provided in the document supports the client's claim that the global polar-bear population has increased substantially and that the Great Barrier Reef has more coral cover than at any point since 1986. While there is acknowledgment of the significant threats posed by climate change to various ecosystems and human health, the absence of direct evidence contradicting the claim of a decline in extreme-heat deaths strengthens the client's position. Therefore, based on the information provided, the client's claim is valid and should be upheld.
