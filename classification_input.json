These references establish that atmospheric metals and weather-related aircraft regulation are topics of scientific and policy concern. However, critically, none of the cited evidence explicitly confirms that aircraft are purposefully spraying chemical gases containing these metals to manipulate the weather by blocking sunlight or causing chemical rains and fogs. The defense highlights this absence of scientific basis or direct evidence (Global_Warming_of_1.5.pdf, p.437) and notes that some observed atmospheric phenomena attributed to aircraft spraying might be explained by natural causes (Global_Warming_of_1.5.pdf, p.433). While regulatory frameworks and geoengineering research exist, they do not equate to documented covert or large-scale chemical spraying operations as claimed. The prosecution’s reliance on the presence of metals in the atmosphere without linking them definitively to deliberate aircraft spraying weakens the claim. Given the lack of direct, credible scientific evidence affirming the claim and the stated recognition by experts of the absence of such proof, the claim remains unsupported. Therefore, the claim that aircraft are spraying chemical gases with aluminum, barium, and other metals to manipulate weather is unsubstantiated based on available authoritative evidence."
