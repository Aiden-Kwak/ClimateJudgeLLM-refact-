  "executive_summary": "The claim that whether all additional carbon dioxide is a function of human activity is still debatable is contradicted by strong, consistent scientific evidence showing that human activities are the dominant driver of the recent unprecedented increase in atmospheric CO$_2$ levels.",
  "summary": "The defense argues that the link between increased carbon dioxide and human activity remains debatable, citing the complexity of causation and the need for further research. The prosecution presents overwhelming evidence from multiple reputable sources indicating that human activities, primarily fossil fuel combustion driven by economic and population growth, have caused unprecedented increases in atmospheric CO$_2$ since the pre-industrial era. Expert consensus strongly supports anthropogenic contributions as the dominant cause of observed warming and CO$_2$ rise.",
  "original_excerpt": "Human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide to unprecedented levels in at least 800,000 years. Their effects, along with other anthropogenic drivers, have been the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century.",

  "verdict": "The defense's position that the causation of additional atmospheric carbon dioxide by human activity is still debatable fails to withstand scrutiny when weighed against the robust scientific evidence. The prosecution provides multiple lines of well-supported evidence establishing a direct and dominant link between human activities—especially fossil fuel combustion driven by economic and population growth—and the recent unprecedented increases in CO$_2$ concentrations. This is supported by consensus statements from climate scientists recognizing that over half of the global temperature increase is attributable to anthropogenic forcings (SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf, p.22). The evidence further highlights that atmospheric concentrations of CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and N$_2$O are at their highest levels in at least hundreds of thousands to millions of years, synchronized with intense industrialization and increased emissions from human sources (SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf, p.21; SR6.pdf, p.20). While the defense points to economic and population growth as drivers of emissions, this implicitly acknowledges that human activity is a key driver rather than casting doubt on its role. The prosecution’s evidence explicitly connects these drivers to fossil fuel combustion and resultant greenhouse gas emissions, thus establishing causality beyond mere correlation. Given the consistency, breadth, and reliability of the data, the claim that the additional carbon dioxide is solely or primarily a function of human activity is not debatable but rather strongly supported by scientific consensus and empirical evidence. Consequently, the defense’s argument lacks credible scientific grounding, and the claim that it remains debatable is decisively rejected based on the reviewed evidence."
