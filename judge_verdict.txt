    "executive_summary": "The client claims that global warming is not progressing as predicted because of enhanced plant photosynthesis absorbing more CO₂ than expected, leading to the assertion that climate change is a lie. The prosecution challenges this claim by pointing out weaknesses in the evidence provided and emphasizing the multifaceted nature of climate modeling and anthropogenic influences. The defense relies on a specific study to support their argument.",
    "summary": "The defense argues that increased plant photosynthesis impacting CO₂ absorption is causing global warming to deviate from predictions, while the prosecution challenges this claim by highlighting the limitations of the evidence and the broader factors affecting climate change. The defense's argument focuses on a specific study, while the prosecution emphasizes the complexity of climate modeling and the role of human activities.",
