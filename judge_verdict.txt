The evidence presented contradicts this claim by emphasizing empirical data supporting climate change and its observable impacts.",

The prosecution refutes this claim by highlighting the lack of empirical data supporting it and presenting evidence that contradicts the assertion. The defense argues that plant photosynthesis plays a significant role in climate predictions, but the prosecution underscores the complexity of climate models and the influence of other factors on climate change.",
