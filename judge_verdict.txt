The evidence provided does not support these claims and instead highlights the negative impacts of climate change on polar bears, coral reefs, and extreme-heat deaths.",
    "summary": "The client's claim that the global polar-bear population has increased substantially, the Great Barrier Reef has more coral cover than at any point since 1986, and extreme-heat deaths have declined is evaluated based on the impact of climate change on these aspects. The evidence shows that climate change negatively affects polar bears, coral reefs, and extreme-heat deaths, refuting the client's claims.",
