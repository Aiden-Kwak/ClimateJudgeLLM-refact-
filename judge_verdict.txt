Consensus among climate scientists and evidence from reports clearly support the significant role of plant photosynthesis in global warming, refuting the client's assertion.",
    "summary": "The client claims that global warming is not progressing as predicted because plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO2 than expected, leading to the conclusion that climate change is a lie. The defense argues that the consensus among climate scientists and evidence support the client's claim, highlighting the role of plant photosynthesis. The prosecution counters by pointing out the consensus and evidence that demonstrate the significant impact of plant photosynthesis on global warming, refuting the client's assertion.",
