    "executive_summary": "Based on the evaluation of the claim that global warming is not progressing as predicted due to increased CO2 absorption by plants, the defense argues that climate change is a hoax. The prosecution challenges this claim by highlighting the lack of direct evidence supporting the assertion and the consensus in the scientific community regarding anthropogenic climate change.",
    "summary": "The defense asserts that global warming trends are not following climate model predictions due to plants absorbing more CO2, concluding that climate change is a hoax. The prosecution counters this by pointing out the lack of direct evidence supporting this claim and emphasizing the strong scientific consensus on human-induced climate change.",
