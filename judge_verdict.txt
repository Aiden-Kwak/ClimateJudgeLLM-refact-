    "executive_summary": "The claim that global warming is not progressing as predicted due to increased CO₂ absorption by plant photosynthesis is inaccurate. The evidence does not support this claim, as climate models consider the impact of plant photosynthesis on CO₂ absorption and climate change predictions.",
    "summary": "The defense argues that current climate models underestimate the absorption of CO₂ by plant photosynthesis, leading to a claim that global warming is not progressing as predicted. The prosecution counters by highlighting that the evidence does not support the claim and that climate models do consider the impact of plant photosynthesis on CO₂ absorption. The defense lacks concrete evidence and fails to address key complexities in the carbon cycle and climate models.",
    "original_excerpt": "Global warming is not progressing as predicted by climate models. This is because plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO₂ than expected. Climate change is a lie.",
