The natural variability in ocean temperatures, including both warming and cooling trends, is well understood by scientists and does not negate the overall trend of global warming. It is not accurate to suggest that a short-term cooling trend in the Atlantic Ocean contradicts the overwhelming evidence of long-term global warming.",

While there are mentions of changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and cooling of surface waters in the North Atlantic, the overall context provided supports the fact that the climate system is warming unequivocally.",
    "evidence_used": "The provided context mentions the warming of the climate system since the 1950s, unprecedented changes observed over decades to millennia, warming of the atmosphere and ocean, diminishing snow and ice, rising sea levels, and the likelihood of the weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in recent decades.",

While there are short-term fluctuations in ocean temperatures due to natural variability, the long-term trend shows a warming of the Atlantic Ocean, consistent with global climate change.
