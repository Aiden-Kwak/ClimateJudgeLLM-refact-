            "question": "Temporal analysis: Has the cooling trend in the Atlantic been a consistent pattern over a significant period, or is it a short-term anomaly?",
            "response": "The cooling trend in the Atlantic, particularly related to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), has been observed over a significant period. It is more likely than not that the AMOC has been weakening in recent decades, with evidence of cooling of surface waters in the North Atlantic and a slowdown of the Gulf Stream since the late 1950s. The trend suggests that the AMOC will continue to weaken over the 21st century.",
