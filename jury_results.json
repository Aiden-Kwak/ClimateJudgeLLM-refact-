    "introduction": "This document presents the jury's analysis to evaluate the original claim: 'Global warming is not progressing as predicted by climate models. This is because plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO₂ than expected. Climate change is a lie.'. Below are the detailed responses and evidence for each sub-question.",

            "question": "Expert consensus assessment: What do climate scientists and researchers say about the role of plant photosynthesis in the context of global warming and climate change?",
            "response": "Climate scientists and researchers emphasize the critical role of plant photosynthesis in mitigating global warming. Models demonstrate increased Gross Primary Productivity in temperate latitudes, aiding carbon dioxide removal and modulating greenhouse gases.",

    "conclusion": "Based on the consensus among climate scientists and research findings, plant photosynthesis significantly influences global warming mitigation by enhancing carbon uptake. While models predict CO₂ absorption, disparities with observations stem from various complex factors beyond photosynthesis."
