    "introduction": "This document presents the jury's analysis to evaluate the original claim: 'Global warming is not progressing as predicted by climate models. This is because plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO₂ than expected. Climate change is a lie.'. Below are the detailed responses and evidence for each sub-question.",

Climate models have shown improvements, but discrepancies exist due to various factors contributing to the complexity of climate change understanding."
