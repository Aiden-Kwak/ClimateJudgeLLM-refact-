    "introduction": "This document presents the jury's analysis to evaluate the original claim: 'Global warming is not progressing as predicted by climate models. This is because plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO₂ than expected. Climate change is a lie.'. Below are the detailed responses and evidence for each sub-question.",

            "question": "Data source evaluation: What specific studies or research support the claim that plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO₂ than expected?",
            "response": "The specific studies or research supporting the claim that plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO₂ than expected include: Study by Xiao, J.J., H. Li, J. Jian, and X. Haifeng in 2011 suggests that stratospheric sulfate geoengineering could enhance the terrestrial photosynthesis rate.",
