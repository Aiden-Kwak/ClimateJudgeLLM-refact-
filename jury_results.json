    "introduction": "This document presents the jury's analysis to evaluate the original claim: 'Despite climate change, the global polar-bear population has increased substantially, the Great Barrier Reef has more coral cover than at any point since 1986, and extreme-heat deaths have declined.'. Below are the detailed responses and evidence for each sub-question.",

        {
            "question": "Impact of climate change on polar bear population: How does climate change affect the habitat and survival of polar bears?",
            "response": "Climate change affects the habitat and survival of polar bears in multiple ways. The decrease in sea ice due to warming temperatures results in habitat loss for polar bears. This loss of sea ice impacts their ability to hunt for seals, their primary food source. Changes in temperature and radiation due to sea ice retreat affect the ecosystem, leading to a shift in photosynthetic species impacting the food web. Reduction in sea ice also makes it harder for polar bears to find suitable habitats for breeding and raising young, further threatening their survival.",

            "question": "Impact of climate change on coral reefs: What evidence exists to show the overall impact of climate change on coral reefs despite the current coral cover status of the Great Barrier Reef?",
            "response": "Multiple studies demonstrate the significant impact of climate change on coral reefs. The Great Barrier Reef has experienced substantial coral cover losses due to climate-related factors. Large coral reef systems like the Great Barrier Reef have lost up to 50% of shallow water corals recently, directly influenced by global temperature rise. Instances of back-to-back bleaching events suggest underestimation of climate risks for coral reefs, indicating severe impacts beyond previous predictions.",

            "response": "No direct evidence supports the claim of a decline in extreme-heat deaths. Available information emphasizes increased risks and impacts of extreme heat events on human health. Observations highlight the rise in heat-related mortality in some regions and the potential for heatwaves to elevate mortality rates, but specific studies indicating a decrease in extreme-heat deaths are lacking.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "Based on the above responses and evidence, climate change poses significant threats to both polar bears and coral reefs, leading to habitat loss, declines in coral cover, and increased risks from extreme heat events. However, the specific claim that extreme-heat deaths have declined lacks direct supporting evidence in the provided content."
