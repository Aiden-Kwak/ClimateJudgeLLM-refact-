It has been noted that the upper ocean layers have been warming over the years, with the sea surface temperature showing changes slightly lower than the global mean surface temperature. Additionally, there have been increased occurrences of marine heatwaves, and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has been weakening in recent decades. While some evidence suggests a weakening of AMOC may be linked to anthropogenic factors, further increases in ocean temperatures and more frequent marine heatwaves are expected. Also, the Arctic sea ice extent has been decreasing markedly since 1979, with anthropogenic influences likely contributing to this loss.",
