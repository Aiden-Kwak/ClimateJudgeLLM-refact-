Studies suggest that plant photosynthesis, influenced by factors like stratospheric sulfate geoengineering, plays a significant role in absorbing CO₂ and impacting climate models. However, additional complexities beyond plant photosynthesis, such as alternative factors and feedback loops, contribute to the overall understanding of global warming progression."
